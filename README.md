# Physics Simulation Effect

A minimal 3D physics demo using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/rapier`.

### What it does
- Renders 100 spheres with randomized positions
- Uses Rapier physics with **zero gravity** to create subtle floating interactions
- Includes lighting for depth and visibility

This project was a quick exploration into integrating physics simulation within a React + Three.js environment, using `@react-three/rapier` for performant, real-time physics.

**Tools:** React, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/rapier, Three.js
